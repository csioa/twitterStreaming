Follow these steps to install Apache Spark locally

1. Download the latest version from this website -> http://spark.apache.org/downloads.html

2. Extract the file to Spark's folder. cd to this folder.

3. Build Spark by running this command ->
build/mvn -Pyarn -Phadoop-2.4 -Dhadoop.version=2.4.0 -DskipTests clean package

4. This will take a while. After you are done you can either play interactively
by running ./bin/pyspark and this will prompt you to the Spark command line for
python

5. Or you can submit a task by ./bin/spark-submit <python_file.py>


p.s. steps 4 and 5 apply just for applications using the Python API of Spark
